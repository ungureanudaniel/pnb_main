"Located in the heart of Romania, between urban areas of major importance and "
"close to the famous mountain resort - Sinaia, Bucegi Natural Park is an "
"extremely popular protected area in our country and part of the "
"international Natura 2000 network. Some of the most famous attractions "
"associated with Bucegi Natural Park, besides the large bear population and "
"breath-taking scenery, are the Sphinx and Babele, conglomerate rocks carved "
"by wind erosion. Bucegi Natural Park was established in 2003 by the Romanian "
"government, becoming a sanctuary for the preservation of traditional "
"cultural landscapes, where sustainable human activities are part of nature. "
"With an impressive biodiversity of fauna and flora, including endemic and "
"rare species, this protected area has been a subject of study for local and "
"international biologists since the 19th century. Moreover, many legends and "
"supernatural stories from the Bucegi Mountains have made this area famous as "
"one of the most mysterious in the country"
